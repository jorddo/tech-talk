//         body: "It's true that Austin area shelters are no kill however that comes with some consequences for senior dogs. They tend to stay a long, long time, months, sometimes a year or more, as they overlooked by the many other available choices onsite such as puppies and young dogs. This is the problem we target to help. Our advocacy's goal is to place senior dogs into loving homes as quickly as possible after rescues have been made aware but they remain unselected. In loving foster homes, we can get them any necessary medical care that will help them thrive and live the best of the rest of their lives, Once they are viewed as more adoptable, fosters and our advocacy helps to make land bridges to a final loving home. Our motto is \"A friend till the end\". Every dog deserves that, don't you agree?",
